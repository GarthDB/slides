PRESENTER NOTES (remaining time):
OPEN FOR QUESTIONS

ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:

Q: "Are we on track for December targets?"
A: Yes! Phase 1 is 100% complete (DNA-1479, 1480, 1485 all done). DNA-1485 schema deployment is COMPLETE. The taxonomy work that DNA-1480 initiated is at 70% completion under Nate Baldwin's leadership (he's currently on PTO). RFC approvals by end of month are achievable with current review velocity.

Q: "What's the status of PR 644?"
A: COMPLETE and deployed! PR 644 has been merged and DNA-1485 has been closed. This is a major achievement - the strategic infrastructure that unblocks multiple RFCs is now production-ready. Phase 2 is now technically unblocked for January launch.

Q: "Do we have enough resources for Phase 2?"
A: Current capacity is sufficient for Phase 1 completion. For Phase 2 (Q1 2026), we'll need to coordinate multi-platform rollout timing. Good news is that platform teams are already engaged through governance meetings, so coordination foundation is in place.

Q: "What are the biggest risks?"
A: Three areas: 1) Token consolidation complexity (being managed by Nate), 2) Multi-platform coordination timing for Q1 (need to align schedules), 3) RFC approval timeline (need platform team alignment by end of December). All are manageable with mitigation plans in place.

Q: "How is platform team engagement?"
A: Excellent. All major platforms (Web, iOS, Android, Desktop) are participating in monthly governance meetings and providing valuable RFC feedback. This is exactly what we hoped for from the governance model.
